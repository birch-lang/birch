<h1 align="center">Birch <strong>[ALPHA]</strong></h1>


Not much to read here. I will update this in a bit (working on the website right now).

### Running:

Make sure that you have python3.8 or higher on your system, and run `src/birch.py`.

You can also try it online at [repl.it](https://replit.com/@gaetgu/birch-5#src/birch.py)!
